A flutter project boilerplate using getx .

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Notes

I suggest creating a new flutter project and transfer/copy the following files or code:

- **assets** directory *(assets/images and assets/json)*
- **dependencies**, **dev dependencies** and **flutter** section of **pubspec.yaml** *(not the whole file)*
- **analysis_options.yaml** file
- the whole **lib** folder
